	<p class="mb-4 sm:mb-8">
		Back in my school days, as most of my friends were busy figuring out PlayStation controls, I found myself more fascinated by puzzles and patterns which led me into the captivating world of coding. Starting off with simple scripts to automate mundane tasks, I quickly found myself diving deeper into the realms of software development and cloud technologies. Today, I'm a Software Engineer with a knack for creating scalable, production-grade software solutions, currently sharpening my skills at Indiana University in Bloomington.

	<p class="mb-4 sm:mb-8">
		These days, I'm engrossed in optimizing how data interacts in the cloud and enhancing user engagement with AI-driven insights at my internships and college research work. I thrive at the intersection of efficiency and innovation, constantly pushing the boundaries of what AI and machine learning can achieve in real-world applications.

		When I'm not coding or cloud-busting, you can find me on the badminton court showing the same passion and strategy I bring to my software projects. I live and breathe badminton, always ready to discuss the latest match or that classic game. Off the field, I'm either tackling algorithms like they're opposing those fast smashes or enjoying a strategic deep dive into my latest tech project.

	<p class="mb-4 sm:mb-8">
		Whether I'm developing APIs or new projects that seamlessly connect thousands of data points, I bring the same energy and precision as I do when cheering for my favourite team. So, if you're looking for someone to bring that championship mentality to your tech team or just chat about the latest in tech and sports, I'm your guy!
